<h1>The 3rd, Final Stage - Endgame</h1>


	<p>
    In endgame the balance of powers is well defined, and unless one of the players makes a huge blunder it will stay the same 
    until the end of the game. The engame is the least explored stage out of the three. The option of possible moves is increased 
    drastically at the beginning of the endgame because most of the board is empty and the paths for the pieces are clear. This by 
    itself increases the level of uncertainty, and finding the best move becomes harder. Of course if we are talking about an endgame
    with less than 5 pieces, then it is a much simpler scenario, but these types of simple positions occur only at the end of the 
    endgame. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This is the stage of the game where calculation and intuition are the two most needed skills. Being able to accurately calculate each 
    possible line is a hard thing, and sometimes can start affecting  the brain's ability to use clear judgment. That is why relying 
    on pure calculation is not a good idea and can lead to not seeing, or underestimating, the obvious best move because of its simplicity.
