<h1>The 2nd Stage - Middlegame</h1>


	<p>
    After the development of the pieces is complete, the king is castled (although not a must), and the rooks are connected, then 
    the opening stage is over, and we walk into the middlegame. Here is where most of the battle will take place, at least the 
    most heated part of it. Ideas start to develop into plans for the game in the players' minds, and each one of them sets out to realize his plan. 
    </p>
    
	<p>
	The middlegames are fun to watch because of all the action involved in them. Most of the time the struggle for the center
    continues deep into the middlegame, even after half of the pieces are traded and captured, but sometimes the blockade of 
    the center can last very long, bringing down the pace of the game, and making the game more suitable for strategist (another
    word for positional play), and less comfortable for tactical players. Tactical players depend mainly on their ability to trick 
    the opponent into traps in a succession of a few moves, while positional players set plans for long term goals, and often make 
    moves which seem to be the most boring choices out of all, but end up winning them a game. In general it is harder to play a 
    positional game because it involves maximum attention and very deep analysis of a few lines at a time (usually from 5 to 10 
    moves in depth). But regardless of the types of players that are facing each other, the middlegame is always in a state 
    of major unrest, where space, material, and tempo is gained and lost, and the pendulum of advantage swings back and forth 
    between the players. 
    </p>

	<p>
    Blunders are an unavoidable part of the middlegame. If the players never blundered then the game would be very mechanical, and 
    unattractive. So, although it is most painful when you make that move, and right after you let your fingers go off the piece 
    you just moved you realize what a big mistake that move was, but without making those blunders we never learn quite well; 
    just like in life.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The objectives for a player in the middlegame should be well understood. What is the goal in the middlegame? Why all this crazy action,
    what's the meaning behind it? Well, it is quite simple. Throughout the entire process the sides are trying to solidify their 
    positions, make room on the board by trading the unnecessary pieces, and prepare for a big attack. Of course not all players prefer 
    to think this way, and many will say that they prefer to defend at first, but if you ask them "what are you going to do after you've
    successfully defended?", the answer is going to be the same, attack! 
    </p>

	<p>
    When the aggression is over, and about half of the starting pieces are no longer on the board, it becomes clear which side was the 
    more successful one in carrying on their middlegame objectives. At this point  we can say with some certainty which one of the sides 
    stands a better chance to win the game, although that prediction is purely based on the positional, and material, evaluation of the 
    sides, and only expresses the theoretical analysis of the position. A few final fine-adjustment moves are made, and maybe some more 
    pieces are traded too, and the game is ready to enter its last stage.
