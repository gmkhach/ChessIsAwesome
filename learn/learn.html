	<h2>Studying Chess is a Life-Long Experience!</h2>

	<p>
	This section is designed for the beginners. You can learn the basics of  chess rules, the important concepts about it, 
    the strengths and weaknesses of all chess pieces, their role in different stages of the game, and more. A general explanation 
    can be found on the three distinct stages of the game, with the objectives that players should follow in each one of them. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Studying chess and becoming good at it takes a long time. If you ask me, I would say it's a task that can never be completely 
    accomplished in one, or even ten human lifetimes. The information about it is too vast to be memorized by anyone. But it does 
    not mean at all that you can't have fun with as little as you have studied, or won't enjoy the endless source of the unknown 
	new material even after many many years of constant studies, and should not in any case discourage anybody from taking their 
    first chess book in hands and starting the great journey. Yes, it is a journey, because chess itself is over 4500 years old, 
    and it is impossible to study the game without having to look back into the older times, and consider and learn the various
    aspects of that time, which adds a great historic spice to the whole process of the study.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    There are many different approaches when it comes to studying chess, but none can beat the good old chess literature. There are a
    number of very important books that a chess player should read once she feels comfortable with the rules and the basic aspects of 
    the game. Starting from the mid-nineteenth century a series of great books on chess strategy and positional play have been issued by 
    brilliant chess players such as Aaron Nimzovitsch, or one of the later authors, Mikhail Shereshevsky. Reading these books, and 
    applying the ideas you learned in your games is the only true way to become a good chess player. In our information age, there are 
    many easy ways of teaching chess especially online, but almost all of these sources only teach you some tricks, expecting you to
    memorize the sequence of the moves, or some other bizarre thing, without giving you the reasoning behind those moves.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Don't be intimidated with the overwhelming amount of material that will fall on you at first, and probably will crush your ego 
    when you don't get a single draw in your games against good players for a long time, but those losses will do you a tremendous 
    amount of good in the end. But if you learn a trick or two, and then go on by winning a few games playing inexperienced players you 
    might feel good about yourself, but that's as good as you will ever be in chess with that approach.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    After you spend a great deal of time on your chess studies and understand the dynamics of the positional play you will find that 
    aside from the books there is another great way of learning chess. That is by looking at the masterpieces of the past giants. You 
    would understand almost nothing if you looked at these games before some serious studies are done with the books, but once you 
    have enough theoretical background and enough playing experience, these games will open up to you, and you will enjoy going through 
    them like you enjoy listening to your favorite band. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    So, be patient and don't give up, and chess will embrace you for your whole life.
