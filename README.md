## Web Design Course Project - Globe Institute of Technology
### Gabriel Khachatryan - 2013

This small website was created as a course project for my web design class at Globe Institute of Technology.

The the code is quite frankly horrible, with hard-coded data in script tags (I didn't know databases exist back then). However, this project still has some value to me, because it was only a basic HTML course I was taking, and I went well beyond the scope of the course to deliver a functional product with extremely limited knowledge.

The most important outcome of this project was that I got into coding after experiencing the freedom that development offers.
